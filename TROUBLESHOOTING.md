# Troubleshooting
Things that can go wrong and how to fix them (hopefully).  

## WiFi Issues
Reboot network devices in order.  
1. WiFi Router(s) - The Deco X90s  
2. DHCP Server - The Firewalla  
3. Internet Modem - The ATT Fiber Modem

## Internet
If just a single device is having issues:  
1. Turn wifi off/on.  
2. Reboot the deivce.  

If that doesn't work, or there are widespread issues then:  
1. Use cellular data to see if there is an internet outage.  
2. Reboot the Internet Modem.  

## Lightswitch Buttons (Flic2)
Try bringing the button closer to the hub (just under the top of the stairs) and press it a bunch of times for like 30 seconds.  
If the buttons are blinking red, make sure the Flic2 Hub is powered on. Turning the breakers off/on might knock out the power strip which defaults to off.  

## Home Assistant
If we can't even ssh into the server, hard reboot the server.
